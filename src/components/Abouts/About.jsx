                    I recently graduated from Davao del Norte State College with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My journey as a full-stack developer started when I chose this IT course. It all began because I have a friend dreaming of building a game. That idea sparked something in me and I realized that programming was the key, and I wanted to be part of that world.
                    In my first year in 2021, I was really eager to learn. I started with Java guided by my instructor. I was learning a lot like basics and concept of programming, but to be honest, I did not find it exciting at first. Creating a simple Java GUI did not really enough on me, and I struggled to stay motivated while studying on my own. Eventually, I stepped back from coding for a while and turned my attention to something else someone I loved, and also focus on drawing portraits.

                    By my second year, I started to improve. I started learning frontend development with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript. I also got a quick look at backend development using PHP. It was all still new to me but what really reignited my passion was a data structures and algorithms course. It was hard, and honestly I did not get it right away but the problem-solving aspect pulled me in. Completing our final project gave me a real sense of accomplishment. That feeling pushed me to explore Laravel, and even though my system wasn’t perfect, I was proud of it. More importantly, I was starting to believe in my ability to solve problems and debug on my own.

                    My third year was all about growth. I explored more tools and languages—C#, .NET Core, and basic Python. I got into modern frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, and even built a mobile app using Flutter. One of the highlights of the year was collaborating with students from Mapúa University on their capstone project. We used the MERN stack, and it was a challenging yet rewarding experience that really put my skills to the test in a real-world setting.

                                    As I entered my fourth year, I found myself fully committed to the MERN stack. I am currently helping another student with their capstone project and I am really excited about. It is more than just applying what I’ve learned; it is also a way for me to support my family and ease some of the financial burden. I am grateful for the chance to use my skills in a meaningful way and be part of someone else’s success.
